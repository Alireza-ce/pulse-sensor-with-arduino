# pulse sensor with arduino

This project aims to design and implement hardware and software for an IoT-based heart rate analysis system. The system helps people in the community to check their heart function based on heart rate and alerts them to consult the doctor if it detects a problem. Also, it provides a record for doctors to help analyze their patient's heart function based on heart rate without the need for the patient to go to the office and be physically present.
The hardware components of this project include the WeMos D1 board and pulse sensor, and to implement the user panel has been used  Angular and NodeJS frameworks.
